# Zero-Shot - Text Classification with Large Language Models

Text classification using zero-shot prompting. Text classification is crucial for organizing information, enhancing search engines, and improving user interaction. Our study uses the [BBC News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pariza/bbc-news-summary) categorizing news articles into Business, Technology, Sports, Politics, and Entertainment.

**Key Objectives:**

- To benchmark the performance of various LLMs.
- To demonstrate the application of zero-shot learning in real-world datasets.

## Results and Interpretations - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

We have conducted tests using a 500-sample dataset to evaluate the performance of each model. Below is a summary of our findings presented through various metrics
